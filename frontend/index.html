        <p>
          I couldn’t find the right coding tutor or the right platform to grow
          as a freelancer — so I built one. A home for freelancers and clients
          to connect, safely and fairly.

      <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
      <p>
        I have a Bachelor's in Economics and Statistics, but my heart was in
        computers. I couldn’t find the right tutor who could teach me real-world
        programming — so I taught myself. I spent over 80 hours a week learning,
        coding, failing, and improving.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was ready to work, I couldn’t find a job. I joined a startup as
        an unpaid intern, surviving on borrowed money just to keep coding.
        Everything changed when I met an Indian chess tutor named Tanvi, who
        connected me with my first client — a parent in Scotland looking for a
        coding tutor for his son. That £100 changed my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        From that moment, I realized how powerful online freelancing could be.
        But I also saw the problems — scams, unverified users, and hidden fees.
        So I built this platform to fix that. A place that values skill,
        integrity, and fairness — for freelancers and clients alike.
